Doin your mom doin doin your mom
Doin your mom doin doin your mom
Doin doin your mom doin doin your mom
You know we straight with doin your mom
Doin your mom doin doin your mom
Doin your mom doin doin your mom
Doin doin your mom doin doin your mom
You know we straight with doin your mom
I'm doin your mom. Yes yours!
I first saw her in the Wal-Mart pickin out your drawers.
Big Dolly Parton hair like an 80s prom queen
But her ass was lookin good all up in those mom-jeans.
I approached her in the checkout line, and said yo baby wassup?
She had two gallons of milk, and I was starin at her jugs.
Five minutes later she agreed to get with me
So we went and rocked the minivan like Giggity. Giggity. Giggity.
I was ridin your mom like she was Mario Kart.
I gave her a lift back to her crib cause her car wouldn't start.
She invited me in the house, and we started makin out again.
How many times I tap that ass? OVER 9000!
Yeah. She called me Pledge cause I knocked the dust off it.
She later made me a sandwich and she cut the crust off it.
Cause she knows how I like it, and that I'm a little young
To be in the bed, butt-naked doin your mom.
Doin your mom doin doin your mom
Doin your mom doin doin your mom
Doin doin your mom doin doin your mom
You know we straight with doin your mom
Doin your mom doin doin your mom
Doin your mom doin doin your mom
Doin doin your mom doin doin your mom
You know we straight with doin your mom
I like your mamas big butt, and I cannot lie.
You other brothers can't deny that she's fly.
We make sexy time, yes and every night I tap that.
She saw me butt-naked, now she thinks I'm half black.
But your moms the best, the super M.I.L.F.
Cause she loves to toss the salad even though she ain't a chef
And I blame it on the al-al-al-cohol
But If I were you, I wouldn't kiss your mom on the mouth at all.
She likes the Donkey-Punch. She likes the Dirty Sanchez.
Sometimes she even likes to fool around in your bed.
She likes rough sex with handcuffs and I'll be honest
She likes me to Chris Brown her when she acts like Rihanna.
She's so therapeutic. When I need to cure my restlessness
I br-br-br-br-br-br-br-br motorboat your moms breastestess.
I didn't wanna tell you, but I had to write this song
Cause I'm in your house every night doin your mo-om.
Doin your mom doin doin your mom
Doin your mom doin doin your mom
Doin doin your mom doin doin your mom
You know we straight with doin your mom
Doin your mom doin doin your mom
Doin your mom doin doin your mom
Doin doin your mom doin doin your mom
You know we straight with doin your mom
I'm havin sex with your mother
That makes me better than you.
I'm havin sex with your mother
That makes me better than you.
Doin your mom doin doin your mom
Doin your mom doin doin your mom
Doin doin your mom doin doin your mom
You know we straight with doin your mom
Doin your mom doin doin your mom
Doin your mom doin doin your mom
Doin doin your mom doin doin your mom
You know we straight with doin your mom
